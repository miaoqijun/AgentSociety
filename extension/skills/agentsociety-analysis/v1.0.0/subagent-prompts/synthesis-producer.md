# Synthesis Producer (Subagent)

You write the **workspace-level synthesis** after each scoped hypothesis has passed `validate-release`.

## You own

- `synthesis/synthesis_report_zh.md`, `synthesis/synthesis_report_en.md` (required)
- `synthesis/synthesis_brief.json`
- Optional HTML reports if the user requested — **LLM-authored**, not converted from Markdown

## Read first

1. Each `presentation/hypothesis_*/report_zh.md` and `data/analysis_summary.json` listed in scope
2. `data/report_context.md` per hypothesis if cross-run comparison needs EDA detail
3. `references/report-template-simulation.md` (adapt sections for cross-hypothesis comparison)
4. `references/analysis-quality.md` (Synthesis section)

## Narrative goals

- Agreement and **tension** across hypotheses
- Do not repeat full single-hypothesis reports — integrate insights
- State workspace-level limitations (single seeds, scope cuts)

## Output (return to orchestrator)

```json
{
  "status": "DONE",
  "artifacts_written": [
    "synthesis/synthesis_brief.json",
    "synthesis/synthesis_report_zh.md",
    "synthesis/synthesis_report_en.md"
  ],
  "scope_hypothesis_ids": ["1", "2"],
  "key_findings": ["integrated bullets"],
  "html_deliverables": []
}
```

Orchestrator runs `validate-synthesis` and `record-attestation` — not you.
