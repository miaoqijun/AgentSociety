# Literature Search Data Sources

The service searches **all sources by default** when `sources` is not specified. Local knowledge base results are always displayed first.

| Source | Description | Content Type |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| local | RAGFlow local knowledge base | Imported full-text documents |
| arxiv | arXiv preprint platform | Physics, Math, CS, etc. |
| crossref | DOI metadata database | Journal paper metadata |
| openalex | OpenAlex academic graph | 250M+ academic papers |

## API Response Fields

Each article in the response contains:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| title | string | Article title |
| authors | list | Author list |
| abstract | string | Article abstract |
| year | integer | Publication year |
| journal | string | Journal name |
| doi | string | DOI identifier |
| url | string | Original link |
| score | float | Relevance score |
| source | string | Data source (local/arxiv/crossref/openalex) |

Additional source-specific fields may be preserved in `extra_fields` inside `papers/literature_index.json`.

Common full-text or open-access hints include:

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| pdf_url | Direct PDF URL if the service provides one |
| full_text_url / fulltext_url | Candidate full-text URL |
| download_url | Candidate download URL |
| open_access | Open-access metadata block |
| best_oa_location | Preferred open-access location from OpenAlex-like sources |
| primary_location | Primary publication location metadata |

These fields are hints for Claude/user follow-up. The search command should still be considered successful even when no original PDF is available.

## Source Behavior Notes

- `local`: may already represent full text in the local knowledge base, but the saved workspace artifact is still a Markdown note.
- `arxiv`: often has a predictable PDF URL. Convert `/abs/<id>` to `/pdf/<id>.pdf` when the original PDF is needed.
- `crossref`: usually returns metadata and DOI links. It often does not provide open PDFs.
- `openalex`: may include open-access locations, but availability varies by paper.
