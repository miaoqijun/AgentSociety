Upgrade to the latest [PyPI release](https://pypi.org/project/agentsociety2/) before reporting an issue.

Security scanning (CodeQL, Dependabot, CI audits) is scoped to AgentSociety 2 paths. See [`.github/agentsociety2-scope.yml`](./.github/agentsociety2-scope.yml).

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Do not** open a public GitHub issue for exploitable vulnerabilities or exposed credentials.

Report privately with:

- Description and impact
- Steps to reproduce (PoC if possible)
- Affected component, version, or commit hash
- Suggested fix or mitigation (optional)

**Contact**

- Email: agentsociety.fiblab2025@gmail.com
- For non-sensitive hardening suggestions, you may use the [Security issue template](https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/AgentSociety/issues/new?template=security_vulnerability.md) on GitHub

## Disclosure

We will acknowledge receipt, investigate, and coordinate a fix and release. We aim to provide an initial response within a reasonable timeframe.

## Security practices for contributors

- Never commit API keys, tokens, or `.env` files
- Run `pre-commit` hooks (`detect-private-key` is enabled)
- Extension `.env` writes escape sensitive values; do not log API keys
- Backend path helpers reject `..` and null bytes in user-supplied paths
