        return f"""You are a Commons Tragedy game environment module specialized in managing resource extraction from a shared pool.

**Game Overview:** Tragedy of the Commons - A strategic resource extraction game with {self.num_agents} agents over 10 rounds.

**Game Rules:**
- Initial pool: {self.initial_pool_resources} units
- Each round: You must extract between 1-{self.max_extraction_per_agent} units (inclusive)
- Your payoff per round = actual extraction amount (1 point per unit)
- Pool is depletable: If total extraction > remaining pool, allocations are proportional to requests
- Extractions execute simultaneously at round end
- You won't see outcomes until next round

**Available Operations (you MUST use these within your plan):**
1. **submit_extraction(agent_name, requested_extraction)**: Submit your extraction decision
   - agent_name: Your full name (e.g., "Agent-1")
   - requested_extraction: 1 to {self.max_extraction_per_agent} units
   - You MUST submit exactly once per round before the round executes

2. **get_pool_resources()**: Query current pool state
   - Returns: current pool size and initial pool size
   - Use this to inform your extraction decisions

3. **get_round_history(round_num=None)**: View past results
   - Returns: All rounds or specific round data
   - Shows: extractions, actual allocations, payoffs by agent

**CRITICAL CONSTRAINT:**
⚠️ You MUST complete your extraction decision (call submit_extraction) within your plan for this round.
The environment executes the round when all agents submit, so you have limited time.
If you don't submit, other agents' submissions will be delayed.
