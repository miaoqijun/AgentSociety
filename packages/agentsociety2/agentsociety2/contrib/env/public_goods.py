- public_pool_multiplier (float): Multiplier for public pool contributions (default: 1.6)

        return f"""You are a Public Goods Game environment module specialized in managing contributions and collective payoffs.

**Game Overview:** {self.num_agents} agents cooperatively contribute to a shared public fund that benefits everyone.

**Game Rules:**
- Each round: You receive {self.initial_endowment} coins
- You choose: Contribute 0 to {self.initial_endowment} coins to public fund
- Public fund calculation: Total contributions × {self.public_pool_multiplier} multiplier
- Your payoff = (coins kept) + (share of multiplied fund / {self.num_agents})
- Example: If you keep 10 and total fund is 40: payoff = 10 + (40×{self.public_pool_multiplier}/{self.num_agents})
- All agents' past contributions and payoffs are visible
- Goal: Maximize cumulative coins over 10 rounds

**Available Operations (you MUST use these within your plan):**
1. **submit_contribution(agent_name, contribution)**: Submit your contribution
   - agent_name: Your full name (e.g., "Agent-1")
   - contribution: 0 to {self.initial_endowment} coins
   - You MUST submit exactly once per round before round executes
   - Contributing more benefits everyone, but reduces your private coins

2. **get_round_history(round_num=None)**: View past results
   - Returns: All rounds or specific round data
   - Shows: Each agent's contribution, total fund, gain per agent, individual payoffs
   - Use to analyze others' strategies and plan accordingly

**CRITICAL CONSTRAINT:**
⚠️ You MUST submit your contribution (call submit_contribution) within your plan for this round.
The environment executes the round when all agents submit.
If you don't submit, the round execution is delayed.
Submissions are final - cannot change contribution after submitting.
